Iâ€™m a biostatistician and data scientist who works with clinicians and researchers to transform data into insights that improve health care and outcomes. My work focuses on the design of high-quality, innovative studies, with a strong emphasis on methodological rigour, collaboration, and real-world impact.

```{r setup-impact-summary, echo=FALSE, eval=!file.exists("impact_summary.md")}
source("update_impact.R")
```

```{r, results="asis"}
cat(readLines("impact_summary.md"), sep = "\n")
```
