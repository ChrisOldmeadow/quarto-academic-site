## ðŸ§ª Research Projects

### Adaptive trials in Implementation Science

This project applies Bayesian adaptive trial designs to optimise complex, multi-component implementation strategies in real-world settings. Leveraging tools such as arm-dropping, response-adaptive allocation, and factorial designs, the aim is to efficiently identify effective components of implementation interventions. The goal is to accelerate scale-up by improving trial efficiency, reducing uncertainty, and tailoring interventions to context.

* PhD student: Erin Nolan
* Collaborators: Dr Alix Hall, Prof Liz Holliday, Dr Daniel Barker 


### Pragmatic Target Trials

Developing methods and guidelines for Target Trials in pragmatic evaluations, like cluster comparative studies. Major applied project as part of the evlaiton and impact of the Diabtes Aliance Project Plus (DAP+).

* PhD Student: Josh Dizon
* Collaborators: Prof Alexis Hure, Dr Daniel Barker, Dr Patrick Skippen 

### AI-powered models to predict whether medical research will lead to translation
This project develops machine learning and large language model (LLM)-based tools to predict the translational potential of research projects. By analysing research outputs, contextual metadata, and downstream indicators such as patents, policy citations, and media coverage, the models aim to classify and forecast which projects are most likely to lead to real-world impact. The goal is to support strategic research investment, enhance impact planning, and accelerate pathways from discovery to translation.


* PhD Student: Matthew Clapham
* Collaborators: Dr Simon Deaming, Dr Carlos Riveros

### Health Informatics in the Hunter
Building infrastructure to support rapid and secure access to NSW Health linked administrative and clinical data for research purposes.

* Health Informatician: Shaun Grady
* Collaborators: Port Waratah Coal Services, Hunter New England Health District
